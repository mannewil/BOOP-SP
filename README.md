# BOOP-SP
Semester work for OOP subject. Presented as/is.
The gist of the semester work was:
1) Create an inheritable class, that extends to three (or more) classes. In my case, it was "ComputerComponent", which extended to CPU, GPU and RAM.
2) Make your own Linked List structure, that is generic (thus, universal for objects)
3) Make the application work, by doing what's needed of it. Use "Facade" as a guiding point for programming.
4) Make GUI that is understandable, and works for the user.

In the end, what we have is an application that allows the user to enter their data (or generate) into fields, and make new objects. The user can save the data into a file, and load from it.
